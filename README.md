# Train-Schedule

This Train Scheduler was created to experiment with the Moment.js library and to have integration with Google Firebase, to maintain persistence across sessions and machines. The front end uses Bootstrap, and next train times and minutes away will be updated every 6 seconds.
 
New trains can be added to the schedule using the form below.
